                                    only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.

                                    transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and
                                    if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                                    divided by arches into stiff sections.

                                <h1>
                                    To take a trivial example
                                </h1>

                                <p>
                                    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
                                    has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
                                    pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men
                                    who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
                                    blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to
                                    ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
                                    will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
                                    His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
                                    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His
                                    room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its
                                    four familiar walls.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    he wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection:
                                    he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
                                    avoid worse pains.But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
                                    pleasure and praising pain was born and.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and
                                    more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting
                                    language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new
                                    common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European
                                    languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an
                                    English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge
                                    friend of mine told me what Occidental is.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a
                                    myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.
                                </p>

                                    To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
                                    except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a
                                    man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
                                    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce.

                                    His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
                                    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His
                                    room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its
                                    four familiar walls.

                                    more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting
                                    language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new

                                    languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an
                                    English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge
                                    friend of mine told me what Occidental is.

                                    Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than
                                    doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,
                                    worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with
                                    different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become
                                    friendly with them.

                                    The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a
                                    myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.
